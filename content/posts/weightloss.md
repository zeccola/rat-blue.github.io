# Introduction
My name is Ethan, I used to weigh around 135kg at 178cm. I now weigh around 85kg and am still losing weight. The below information is information that I have learned over my journey that I wish I knew before I started my weight loss journey. This is **NOT** a medical guide, my background is in I.T and not medicine, check with your doctor before trying all this yada yada yada.

I need to stress this, weight loss is probably 90% diet, 10% exercise.

# Consistency
The **MOST** important part of this, is going to be consistency. You can have bad days, but if your overall

# CICO:
Your body takes in specific amount of calories, and uses a specific amount of calories. If you eat more than you use, your body stores the surplus as fat on your body. If you eat less than you use, your body dissolves your fat storage and uses that as energy. That's how fat loss works, you need to use more energy than you eat. Luckily, your body uses heaps of energy just to stay alive (energy needed to pump your heart, breathe etc.) and the **vast** majority of your total energy burned in the day is literally just your body doing this. 

You need to first work out how much energy your body is using. Use this calculator (you can ignore body fat %) https://tdeecalculator.net/. It will tell you your maintenance calories, for example it may say 2500 calories, then to lose weight all you need to do is to eat less than 2500 calories.

**To lose 0.25kg a week:**
eat 250 calories less, so eat 2250 calories a day.

**To lose 0.5kg a week:**
eat 500 calories less, so eat 2000 calories a day.

**To lose 1kg a week:**
eat 1000 calories less, so eat 1500 calories a day (very hard).

A lot of people think that you can lose weight this way by burning extra calories at the gym, but its not very efficient. In one hour of working out you might burn 300 calories, which is about as much as one medium fries at mcdonalds, or 2 cans of coke. So if you are trying to lose weight, its so much easier to eat less food than it is to work out for an entire hour that day. I hope you understand the emphasis I am placing on weight loss being mostly about eating **less**, rather than working out more.

# Exercise:
As I've said above, its easier to lose weight by eating less than it is working out more, but working out gives you bigger muscles and can make you look more toned. The only issue is that the more you work out, the hungrier you get. For this reason, I do NOT recommend working out until you have your diet sorted. For me, I was doing diet only without any working out for 3 months until I built up the diet habit, then I SLOWLY started going back to the gym (once a week for a month, then twice a week for a few months, then 3 times a week etc.). This is crucial, as hunger is the main enemy to weight loss as it will make you cheat on your diet.

That being said, when you do start going to the gym, you can use my workout split. I split my days into 'push' and 'pull' days (read more here https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/push-pull-workout) but basically if you work out your biceps, you are also probably using your back and forearms as well so we combine them into one day. If you are working out your triceps, you are probably also using your chest and shoulders as well, so we combine them into one day too. For the below exercises, watch some youtube videos on how to do the proper form.

**Arms push (triceps, chest, shoulders):**
(each exercise do one set of 10, 8 and 6 reps or however many sets you want)
Chest press
Shoulder press
Front raise
Lateral raise
Tricep pushdown
20 mins cardio. (aim for heartrate around 140-160)

**Arms pull (biceps, back and forearms):** 
(again, each exercise do one set of 10, 8 and 6 reps or however many sets you want)
Low Row or T-bar row
Lat-pulldown
Dumbbell shrug
Preacher curl
Rear delt fly
20 mins cardio. (aim for heartrate around 140-160)

**Legs:**
(again, 10, 8 and 6 reps or however many sets you want)
Deadlift (normal or romanian deadlift)
Leg press or squats
Leg curl
Leg extension
Calf Raise
Good mornings
20 mins cardio. (aim for heartrate around 140-160)

The cardio is optional but recommended, and can be anything. I like to use the elliptical or the treadmill. You can also do cardio by playing sports like soccer or afl etc. which will make it a lot more fun and tolerable. Be aware that your performance will be a bit shit in the gym if you are restricting your eating, but you can ignore that and just don't push yourself too hard.

A few tips:
1. You **can't** "spot" lose fat, so if you work out your abs, you don't lose fat in your abs. Your body will randomly take fat from all around the body, and can't 'choose' where to take fat from.
2. Make sure to have carbs before a workout, it will help your performance. I normally have a banana about 45 mins before working out.
3. Try to have fun while working out. If you hate using the treadmill, try jogging in the bush or park. If you find the gym boring, try do swimming instead or another activity you will actually enjoy. Even things like playing paintball or something will get you pretty exhausted and is good cardio to do.
4. Make sure to have adequate protein, otherwise you won't build muscle. (more on that below)

# Diet:
Your diet should mainly consist of healthy food, although to be honest you should care more about the calories than the content of the food. As I've stressed before, you need to eat less calories than you use. You can use an app such as mynetdiary to count your calories in the food you eat. In Australia, we typically use Kj to count instead of Calories, although lots of boxes have both on there. A quick rule of thumb is that 1 calorie is about 4 kj which should help you convert between the two. Use the app to count the amount of calories, and optionally also the protein, carbs and fats.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-mynetdiary/id287529757

You don't have to use this app specifically, use any app you want but make sure you enter EVERYTHING you eat (including the cooking oil used).

There are 3 main groups of food, protein, carbs and fats. if you only care about losing weight, you can ignore the stuff below, but if you want to be healthy and put on muscle, it's important to understand it.

**Protein:**
Probably the most important one. It's used to build muscle, and is hardest for your stomach to break down, meaning protein stays in your stomach longer and makes you feel more full for longer. You can also supplement protein through protein shakes too, which I recommend drinking after a workout as well as every day. Good sources of protein include meat (chicken and fish especially, but also pork, beef etc.), beef jerky, high protein yoghurt, beans and lentils, cheese etc.

You should aim for having 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight, so if you are 85kg, then you should aim to have 136-187g of protein per day.

**Carbs:**
Carbs are used by your body for energy for your muscles to work, and are important. If you go to the gym without carbs, you will feel like you have less energy. Good sources of carbs are things like rice, cereal, potato, lentils, fruit.

**Fats:**
Fats are also important. Most people instinctively think that if you eat fats you become fat, but this isn't really true. As long as you don't have too many calories overall then you won't put on extra fat. Fat is important because it's used by your body to create hormones (such as testosterone) and if you don't have enough fat, you'll feel like shit, tired, cold etc. Try to have around 50 grams of fat per day. Try to eat good fats like olive oil, avocado, MCT oil.

**Convenience:**
Sometimes I can't be fucked cooking lunch, so I want something quick. That's usually when you buy a meal, so make sure you have something ready for that. **DO NOT** eat these every day, I only have them once or twice a week when I can't be fucked making lunch. I recommend some of the following products, they are ready made, cheap, high protein meals and are usually around 600 calories each:
- FroPro is quite good, they do pizzas and fried chicken and they all equal around 600 calories

	- https://www.coles.com.au/product/fropro-protein-slices-pepperoni-pizza-2-pack-360g-6840762
	- https://www.coles.com.au/product/fropro-fpfc-sweet-chilli-tenders-300g-8958515
- My muscle chef also make decent 
	- https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/278049/my-muscle-chef-beef-ravioli-with-napolitana-sauce
	- https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/178806/my-muscle-chef-spaghetti-bolognese
Another thing you can do is to come up with set meals that are easy to make and you know are around a certain amount of calories. For example, I used to make a sandwich from stuff at woolies with roast beef, pickles, mustard etc. and knew the exact amount of calories in the sandwich.

**Tips:**
- REMEMBER TO COUNT YOUR COOKING OIL
	- Oil is super high in calories, 1 tablespoon is around 120 calories. Thats around the same amount of calories as a banana. Using it sparingly and remember to enter it into your calorie counting app.
- Eat foods high in fiber. Fiber is good for you but will also make you feel more full.
- Tinned fish is super convenient, tasty and fills you up. Things like tinned salmon or tinned tuna with rice and beans + some sauce can make a really quick and filling low calorie meal.
- Try go for the lite/low fat/low calorie products at woolies. They taste like shit but they do have less calories.
- I **highly recommend** making a calorie budget. If you are eating 2000 calories a day, budget the calories per meal:
	- Eg 200 calories for breakfast, 600 calories for lunch, 1200 calories for dinner. This equals 2000 in total.
	- Or skip breakfast and do 800 calories for lunch and 1200 calories for dinner
- Go on youtube and search "high protein low calorie meal", there are some banger recipes on there
	- eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlsrmJvk9f4
- Caffeine helps a lot with hunger. Caffeine is a stimulant and therefore will make you feel less hungry.
	- Remember though that a Latte with 1 sugar has around 200 calories. I would recommend having black coffee which has a lot less calories in it, or zero sugar energy drinks.

# Other random tips:
- Weigh yourself. But don't do it every day, do it once a week or twice a month or so and write it down in an excel spreadsheet or on your phone or something. Keep in mind that your body will retain weight through water. If you are overhydrated or have too much salt, it may appear as though you've gained weight on the scale but in reality it's just your body retaining water. Its possible to gain 1-2kg in water weight alone.
	- Try weigh yourself in the morning after you use the bathroom, and try not to drink any water before then. If you drink 500ml water before you weigh yourself, you will be 0.5kg heavier than you actually are.
- **Alcohol** contains calories, even spirits. One shot of vodka is around 100 calories, and a beer is around 150 calories. You don't have to quit drinking, but it will massively help your weight loss.
- Soft drinks are tasty but try to avoid having the full sugar ones. Go for the coke zero or sprite zero etc. drinks as they usually only have 4-5 calories per drink. They don't taste as good but they have almost no calories in them.
- Cheat days can be ok, but you should still count the calories on your cheat day and don't go over too much. If you have a calorie deficit of 500 per day for 6 days, that's 3000 calories. If on the 7th day you overeat by 3000 calories, then you've just undone all the progress you've done during the whole week.
- Don't keep junk food in your home, if you don't have any junk food in your house then you are less likely to eat it.
- It's probably a good idea to take supplements, you will be eating less than you need and should make sure your basic nutritional needs are met
	- Vitamin d, take around 2000IU a day if you are white, and around 3000iu if you are black.
	- Omega 3, try take around 2 capsules per day.
	- A multivitamin.
	- Calcium supplement.
	- Creatine (5g per day)
		- Helps to convert ADP back into ATP, which can give you extra energy with bursty activities.
		- Note, you must take this every day to receive a benefit, and it takes around 1 month until you fully start receiving the benefits. It will also make you gain about 1kg of water weight, however that is all weight that goes into your MUSCLES (1g of creatine binds to around 4-5g of water, and creatine is stored inside your muscles), which makes them look more toned.
- Sleep is SUPER SUPER important. It helps your body rest, and I always find that I perform better with at LEAST 7 hours sleep per night. I also find myself more hungry on days where I've slept less
