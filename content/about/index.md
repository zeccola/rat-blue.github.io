I’m Ethan Zeccola, an Azure Consultant with a background in Cybersecurity and a Bachelor of Information Technology.

Outside of work, I run a homelab built around Kubernetes, UNRAID, and dedicated storage, mostly as an excuse to break things and learn how to fix them properly. Some of my hobbies and things I write about include going to the gym, playing music/guitar, cooking (largely smoking / BBQ), Radios, Tinkering, and watching UFC.

This site is a place for notes, write-ups, and the occasional deep technical tangent on things I find useful or interesting, from infrastructure and security to whatever else I’m currently tinkering with.
